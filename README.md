Hi, I’m @r-avg ! I'm a _he_ and I'm a _him_ ＼(＾▽＾)／

I'm currently working as a COBOL developer! But my true interests are coding really poorly in Rust and C and the like.
Among my other passions you might find [music](https://open.spotify.com/artist/4igkCkeFFEMKfVZsWO3PiK) of graphic design (¯︶¯)

If you happen to like the things I do or just want to reach me for any reason, please [email](mailto:ramiroangel@mailbox.org) me!

Have fun browsing through my attempts at programming! toodles
